CSS notes:
    1. CSS stands for cascading style sheets.It is used to describe
    the presentation of HTML , XML pages. 
    2. There are 3 different ways to add CSS to our document:
        1.External stylesheet.
            If we create a new file for css only it is called
            External CSS
        2.Internal Stylesheet.
            If we write style command in the heading and then
            try to complete the css it is called Internal CSS
        3.In-line CSS.
            If we use style as an attribute tjem it's called 
            inline css it takes precedent over anytype of css.
    3.CSS Anatomy:
        example:
            p{
                font-size: 50px;
                color:green;
            }
        In here the p is a tag a SELECTOR
        What is inside the brackets are called declarations
        the color here is called PROPERTY and GREEN IS 
        PROPERTY VALUE.
        The whole structure is called RULESET/RULE.
    There are 3 different types of selectors in CSS.
