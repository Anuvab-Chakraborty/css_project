CSS notes:
    1. CSS stands for cascading style sheets.It is used to describe
    the presentation of HTML , XML pages. 
    2. There are 3 different ways to add CSS to our document:
        1.External stylesheet.
            If we create a new file for css only it is called
            External CSS
        2.Internal Stylesheet.
            If we write style command in the heading and then
            try to complete the css it is called Internal CSS
        3.In-line CSS.
            If we use style as an attribute tjem it's called 
            inline css it takes precedent over anytype of css.
    3.CSS Anatomy:
        example:
            p{
                font-size: 50px;
                color:green;
            }
        In here the p is a tag a SELECTOR
        What is inside the brackets are called declarations
        the color here is called PROPERTY and GREEN IS 
        PROPERTY VALUE.
        The whole structure is called RULESET/RULE.
    There are 3 different types of selectors in CSS.
        1.Element Selector:
            It is created using something like body{then PROPERTY
            and PROPERTY VALUE}
        2.Class Selector.
            It is defined by a ".{classname}" manner.Used to select
            a specific class element.There can be more than one
            type of classes in a single HTML file
        3.Id Selector
            It is defined by a "#{idnName}" manner.
            There should be only 1 ID per page
        4. Universal Selector.
            It is defined by a "*" manner.
            It selects everything on the page.

    Cascade meaning of CSS it means that in CSS everything works
    as in a top-down manner or waterfall manner.
    Class with universal specificity can overwrite the funtions
    given to it by element selectors.

    "!important" overrides everything 
    Border tag is used to create a border around a specific area.

    CSS colors:

        Background-color sets the Background to a desired color.
        We can save colors in many different ways one being rgb
        function.
        rgb color takes 3 arguments
        rgba takes 4 last one deciding the transparency of the text.
        hexadecimal color palette also works from 0-9 and also uses
        alphabets A-F.
        HSL in color means hue saturation and lightness.
        color tools:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CSS Units and Sizes:
        default font-size in any browser is 16px.
        If we use html{font-size:16px;}
        we will declare 16px as the absolute value
        for the font-size.
        People generally use rem to manipulate font-size.
        Rem means that font-size will  be that number of
        times of the root element.
        Font-size declared in the body does get inherited
        in the later portions of the code.Exception being
        forms the form input and buttons doesn't 
        automatically inherit the font-size. To inherit
        the font-size we can do this:
        input,button{
            font-size:inherit;
        } 
        Even if we change the font-size of the parent element
        of which we are using rem it'll not change because it's
        not dependent on the parent element's font size.
        EM is also an PROPERTY of css that can be used.
        But em depends on the parents too.
        We use EM mostly on paddings and margins.

        Width also has another relative property namingly
        ch which sets the character width of the text that
        appears on the page.

        Percentage:
        Let's say we want to change the width of an
        element. If we change the width of its parent
        then the width of it will be the specified
        percentage of the width of it's parent.
        It is mostly used to set the size of a page.

        There's two viewport elements that are left those are
        viewportwidth(vw) viewportheight(vh).
        VW acts as similar to %width but %width is better.
        The body of the page is never the full height of the page
        it only grows along with it's contents.Sometimes we want
        a body that is full height of the page.We can do that 
        using vh.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CSS Box Model:
        In the CSS Box model first comes the content on the most inside layer
        of the box then comes the padding layer then comes the border and then
        comes the margin of the box.
        Usually the margin of a h1 box is set as 0.67em as default in the
        browser.The em is dependent mostly upon the font-size of the element.
        All the minute details can be hard to remember that's why we use a 
        simple css reset. 
        If we write auto after giving the specs of the margin it'll center the
        margin horizontally (in the middle of left and right).

        The default box size set by the browser is called content-box.
        Content-box doesn't account for the padding and the border so if 
        you give it a width of 400px it will not include the padding and 
        border in the 400px and the total would be more than 400px.

        For the case of border box it considers the total of the width given
        as the total area including the padding border and content that's why
        if you give the border box a width of 400 px it will give the content
        space 348px and the padding 24px and the border 2px and keep the whole
        box below 400px.ALTHOUGH MARGIN is NOT INCLUDED in the calculation.


        If we create a class in our HTML file we can manipulate that class in 
        CSS by using .[className]{} as an reference.

        There can be different types of margin.
        top-right-bottom-left. both margin and padding works in this manner.

        For border we also have these four but we can break out attributes like
        border-top into border-top-width,border-top-color,border-top-style etc.

        Outline is not part of the box model because unlike border it doesn't
        takes up any extra space.
        It has two attributes offset which decides the position. It can also 
        take negative values too.

        We may use the border radius attribute to set the height and width of
        a class to half of it's specified height and width and that will help
        us create a circle.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CSS Typography:
        text decoration:
            Text decoration element is used to define how the text should be displayed
            to note text and fonts are two different things.
            If we set text decoration to none , all the links that Usually have underline
            text that turns into normal text.

        Text transform:
            Text transform has different attributes like uppercase, lowercase, capitalize
            it helps us change our text alignments.
            To help us maintain the space alignment with the end of line to make it end 
            together.

        Text indent:
            Works almost same as it's name.EM units is best to use.

        Line-height:
            Line-height takes units as argument. generally 1.2 is the default line height.
            1.5 is recommended.

        Letter-spacing, Word spacing:
            letter spacing takes em as argument.
            Word spacing also same.
        
        Font-weight:
            Font-weight defines if the font is bold or not it actually declares the thickness
            of the font.The normal is around 300-400.

        Font-style:
            Font-style is used to specify the font is of which type like italics or something.

        Font-family:
            Font-family is the type of font used. The default font family is serif.
            for web it's generally sans-serif.monospace, cursive,fantasy.
            vscode suggests different choices at once in an order. If the name has space
            in it then we must include it inside single quotes.ex-'courier new'.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CSS Styling links:

        Usually links comes along with the a tag. So to style links we can use some typography
        methods that we used earlier.
        By setting the text-decoration to none we can remove the default underline that comes
        with the link.

        If the link is visited it means it's state has been changed so we can use that changed
        state to manipulate it's color more by using pseudo-class. It is representated by:
        a:visited{
            color:purple;
        }
        this way.The pseudo-class have more specificity than the regular a tag.
        the link is active when we are clicking and holding onto the link.
        correct order is: visited-hover-active.

        focus pseudo-class is used to activate the links hovering over them while going
        through the page.It goes along with hover pseudo-class.EX:
            a:hover,a:focus{
               color:palevioletred;
               }
        To set almost same hover and link color you can use HSL and change the first number
        there to make it work.We can also use opacity too.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CSS list Styling:

        We use the list style element to give different type of numbering the list has. It has
        many different values like circle , disc , upper-roman etc. EX:
            ol{
                list-style:upper-roman;
            }
        We can also manipulate the list style by adding start="xyz" in the start tag of the list.
        It works like an reference so we can also use alphabets and it'll be same as the change
        being in place of number 3 the  numbering will start from c. EX:
            <ol start="3" reversed>
            <li>Easy</li>
            </ol>
        if we use reversed along with that we will get the numbering in reverse order.
        If we do not want any indent we can set do this:
            ol{
                list-style:none;
                padding:0;
            }

        ul{
            list-style-type: square;
            list-style-position: inside;
            text-align: center;
            color:red;
            list-style-image: url('images/checkmark.png');
            line-height: 1.6;
        }

        in the code above the text-align can create problems if we only use text-align and not
        specify the list-style-position as inside in that case only the list items will move
        and the boxes will stay at the same position.
        Also using color affects everything in the list.
        to use list-style-image the format must be of the type given above.
        to completely write all these property in short hand we may use list-style and then
        specify these attribute. 

        ul li:nth-child(even){
            color: blue;
        }

        in this line we are mentioning first which list we are going to manipulate then we are 
        using a pseudo-class named nth-child to specify the posiion of the child we must
        manipulate. The nth-child takes odd/even or any specific number as it's argument.

        ul ::marker{
            color:green;
            font-size: 1em;
            font-family: fantasy;
            content: "Anuvab is best";
        }
        In this code the marker is a pseudo-element we must mention it with the list we are
        going to style it with otherwise it overwrites all the list then if we use content we
        can create the same thing as a sales page.

        <ol start="3" reversed>
                <li>Step One</li>
                <li value="26">Step Two</li>
                <li>Step Three</li>
        </ol>
        In this line of code as we mention a different value in the list item the numbering will
        change to something that is according to that value in this case the first will be 3 
        second will be 26 third will be 25 element of the numbering patter we are using.


        To manipulate multiple list items we can use border top to differentiate every list item
        with another list item by a straight line. We also use border radius too.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CSS display:
        paragraph in html is a block level element. The block level elements takes up the full 100%
        width of the page.
        They always stack on top of each other.
        They also got some default margins too.
        In block level element it takes up the 100% of the width that is given.

        Span is an in-line level element.In an inline element we can't apply a margin,height.
        Padding applies to an in-line element differently.

        We can use inline-block.
        inline-block applies everything the block does.

        display: none also exists.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CSS Floats:

        TO create 5 paragraph with lorem text the vs code shorthand is :
            p*5>lorem20.
        We can use float left or right to create an effect where we can
        emulate the pages of a newspaper.
